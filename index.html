                    I was born in West Jordan Utah, but grew up most of my life in South Jordan Utah. I have six brothers, five older and one younger; as you can imagine the house got quite rowdy at times. Waiting for breakfast Saturday and Sunday mornings required patience. There was a lot for my mom to cook, and only so much we could eat until more was made. I was practically born with a ball in my hands and played mostly basketball, baseball, and tennis all my life.  I graduated from Bingham High School, where I played tennis, and then served a two year mission, for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, to Spokane Washington speaking spanish.

                    I graduated from Salt Lake Community College with an Associates in General Studies. After that I graduated from The University of Utah with a Bachelors Degree in Exercise and Sports Science, and a minor in Nutrition. I love learning about the body and how it works.  Anatomy was one of my favorite classes that I took.  Even though cadavers smell, it was neat to be able to look at the bones, muscles, tendons, ligaments, etc.  The health and nutrition fields are really important and fun to learn.  I liked all of my classes really.  I never thought it would be so fun to study powerpoints and read textbooks.

                    I am married to my wife, and we have a little guy in the oven to come in January. Am I ready? Nope, but I will have to become ready. He is coming, and it is going to be an adventure. The thought of being a dad is crazy but I love little kids so I am sure to do just fine as a new dad.
